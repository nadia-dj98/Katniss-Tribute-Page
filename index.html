                    <p>Katniss Everdeen is a teenage girl who lives in District 12, an impoverished coal-mining region in the country of Panem. She's a volunteer tribute in Panem's annual Hunger Games, having taken the place of her younger sister in an act of heroic self-sacrifice.</p>

                <h2 class="biography-header">Biography</h2>
                <p>The main character and narrator of the story. Katniss is slender with black hair, grey eyes and olive skin. She is sixteen years old and attends a secondary school somewhere in Appalachia, known in the book as District 12, the coal mining sector. 
                    She is often quiet and is generally liked by District 12's residents, mostly because of her ability to provide highly-prized game for a community in which starvation is a constant threat. 
                    Katniss is an excellent hunter, archer, gatherer, and trapper, skilled just like her deceased father. She and her father shared singing ability, too. Since his death in a mine explosion, which killed Gale's father too, Katniss has been the sole provider for her family, a role she was reluctantly forced to assume at the age of eleven when her mother's grief overcame her ability to function. 
                    Katniss is surprised when her sister is chosen to compete in the Hunger Games, and willingly steps forward to take her place out of love. 
                </p>
                <p>Katniss along with Peeta, another tribute from her District, go on to win the 74th Hunger Games, becoming the first duo victors, and only the third winners from District 12. Katniss survived the arena through her finely honed archery skills and her alliance with Rue, before she was killed. Peeta allied with Careers—tributes who train for the games—then turned on them.</p>
                <p>After making it to the final two, and beating out District 2 career tribute Cato, the two refused to kill one another when the rules allowing for two victors was revoked. They each took a handful of deadly nightlock berries—which killed District 5 tribute Foxface—and threatened to swallow them, which would leave the game with no victors. They were both allowed to win.</p>
                <p>Their win broke the established rules at the time, never mind that the rules had already been changed. Katniss and Peeta refusing to kill the other openly defied the gamemasters and President Snow, and they would pay the price for it</p>
